.SH NAME
autobuild \- Builds and packs a software.
.SH DESCRIPTION
A tool for building a software package from source,
it supports autotools (./configure stuff), cmake, scons, py and pl internally. 

After putting autobuild/define file in the source tree,
use the autobuild command to see how the source code is built into binaries,
then a .deb package. That's cool.
